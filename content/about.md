The EA LA community is a group of individuals in the Los Angeles area who are interested in effective altruism, animal-welfare, supporting effective charities, philosophy, technology and good food. We host monthly dinners but hope to expand the kinds of events and activities we gather for in the future. 

We are a welcoming and inclusive community, and hope to see you at one of our events soon!

If you're interested in voluneering, sharing an opportunity with the community, or have any questions, please reach out to us at:

*Please allow up to 48 hours for a response.*
